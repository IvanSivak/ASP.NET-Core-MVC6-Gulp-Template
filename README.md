ASP.NET Core MVC6 Lightweight Gulp Template

<p>
When you create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application the default template uses built-in .NET Core bundles mechanism which takes care of JavaScript and CSS files bundling and minification. The same can be achieved using well known Gulp and both have their pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I prefer the Gulp over the built-in .NET Core bundles. My projects usually tend to be JavaScript very rich and it is mostly the JavaScript part that grows a lot. As the development goes by sooner or later you will end up using various gulp plugins such as nunjucks for templates processing and many others. Having it all (the minification and bundling) nicely managed by gulp since the beginning brings more clarity to the project and in my eyes is a way more powerful.

<p>
There are alternatives, for example ASP.NET MVC Boilerplate template that uses gulp. Since Boilerplate is quite heavy template I decided to create my own lightweight ASP.NET Core MVC6 Gulp Template.
